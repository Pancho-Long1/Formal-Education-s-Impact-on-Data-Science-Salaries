# Formal-Education-s-Impact-on-Data-Science-Salaries

## Introduction

As someone who is currently making decisions on whether a degree will help out their career within data science, and if so, at what level, understanding the correlation between higher education and income within the industry has always been very interesting to me. I was inspired to partake in this project as I believe it would not only be useful for my own decisions on pursuing further education, but for others as well. Hence, I gathered publicly available data from Kaggle's 2021 reported salaries. Furthermore, I have then compared this data with the World Bank's GNI Ranking, to accurately compare how the value of a degree in the data science field changes depending on country/continent. Hopefully allowing people to make more educated decisions based on their specific location.

## Notes

* People who didn't state their education have been excluded
* The salaries were originally in a range format (40k-60k), to present the information more clearly I changed each range to the middle number between both extremes (50k); therefore the salary amount is not perfectly accurate but should generally reflect the correct trends.
* When comparing the increase in salary post-education between countries/continents, it must be taken into account that different countries vary in living cost and average wages; therefore, one country having a higher income increase than another post-education doesn't inherently imply it values a degree more. The important attribute to take into account is when a country has a low GNI but a high increase in income post-education (meaning the industry strongly values education), or vice versa.
* A range of countries and continents have not been included as they didn't contain sufficient data to be considered accurate. This shouldn't have too much of an impact on the visualisations as all continents still contain information on a vast range of countries.

## Conclusion

*  Postgraduate education shows a clear positive correlation with income earned, though, there is not a large difference with income between a college education and a bachelor's degree. (Technically the visualisation displays Bachelor's degrees getting lower pay than a college education, this is likely to be because of a sampling bias and not a genuine income drop, as the difference is minimal)
* As expected, the most developed continents have the highest pay increase, though, interestingly, Africa has the lowest GNI yet a higher income increase than Asia. This suggests that Africa values education more than Asia even after taking into account their socioeconomic position.
* Similarly, the highest GNI countries tend to have the highest pay increase, though the interesting part of this visualisation are the countries which do not comply with this idea. Columbia and Nepal both have much lower GNIs yet still have a decent pay increase, suggesting that they value formal education very highly; whilst, Italy and France seem to put much less importance on formal education, having a high GNI yet an increase in income lower than much poorer countries.
